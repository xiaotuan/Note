可以通过 `TextAlignment` 属性设置文本的对齐方式，该属性可设置为 `TextAlignment` 枚举的某个成员：`Left`、`Right`、`Center` 或 `Justify`。其中，`Justify` 能够在词间插入额外的空白，使每行文本都能够在左右两端对齐。

```xml
<Grid Name="contentGrid">
    <TextBlock FontSize="18"
               TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords"
               TextAlignment="Justify">
        For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out
        my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to
        say "I'm going to sleep." And half an hour later the thought that it was
        time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book
        which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I
        had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just
        been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own,
        until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book:
        a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This
        impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not
        disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them
        from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then
        it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former
        existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would
        separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form
        part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I
        would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and
        restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to
        which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark
        indeed.
