你可以使用 `Val` 方法将数字字符串转换成适当的数字类型，其定义如下：

```vb
Public Function Val(Expression As Char) As Integer
Public Function Val(Expression As Object) As Double
Public Function Val(InputStr As String) As Double
```

例如：

```vb
Dim valResult As Double
' The following line of code sets valResult to 2457.
valResult = Val("2457")
' The following line of code sets valResult to 2457.
valResult = Val(" 2 45 7")
' The following line of code sets valResult to 24.
valResult = Val("24 and 57")
```
