### Lesson 1 A private conversation 私人谈话

#### First listen and then answer the question

听录音，然后回答以下问题。

Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.

​    'It's none of your business, ' the young man said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'

参考译文

​        上星期我去看戏。我的座位很好，戏很有意思，但我却无法欣赏。一青年男子与一青年女子坐在我的身后，大声地说着话。我非常生气，因为我听不见演员在说什么。我回过头去怒视着那一男一女，他们却毫不理会。最后，我忍不住了，又一次回过头去，生气地说：“我一个字也听不见了！”

​        ”不关你的事，“ 那男的毫不客气地说，”这是私人间的谈话！”

#### Key structures 关键句型

Word order in simple statements 简单陈述句的语序

a.	A statement tells us about something. All the sentences in the passage are statements. Each of    these statements contains one idea. Each statement tells us about *one thing*. A statement that tells us about one thing is a *simple statement*.

陈述句用来叙述一件事情。本段课文中的所有句子都是陈述句。每个句子包含着一个概念，告诉我们一件事情。凡是叙述一件事情的陈述句都是简单陈述句。

b.	The order of the words in a statement is very important. Look at these two statements. They both contain the words but they do not mean the same thing:

陈述句中的语序很重要，注意下面两个句子，每句话所用的单词相同，但句子所表达的意思不同：

The policeman arrested the thief. 警察逮捕了小偷。

The tief arrested the policeman. 小偷逮捕了警察。

c.	A simple statement can have six parts, but it does not always have so many. Study the order of the words in the following columns. Note that column 6 (When?) can be at the beginning or at the end of a statement.

依噶简单陈述句可以由 6 部分组成，但是并不是每个句子都有这么多组成部分。注意下表中句子的语序。第 6 栏（表示时间）可以放在句首或句尾。
