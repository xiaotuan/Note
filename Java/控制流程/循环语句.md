### 1. while 循环

格式为：

```
while (condition) statement
```

示例：

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * This is the first sample program in Core Java Chapter3
 * 
 * @version 1.01 1997-03-22
 * @author Gary Cornell
 */
public class Retirement {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// read inputs
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.print("How much money do you need to retire? ");
		double goal = in.nextDouble();
		
		System.out.print("How much money will you contribute every year? ");
		double payment = in.nextDouble();
		
		System.out.print("Interest rate in %: ");
		double interestRate = in.nextDouble();
		
		double balance = 0;
		int years = 0;
		
		// update account balance while goal isn't reached
		while (balance < goal) {
			// add this year's payment and interest
			balance += payment;
			double interest = balance * interestRate / 100;
			balance += interest;
			years++;
		}
		
		System.out.println("You can retire in " + years + " years.");
	}

}
```

### 2. do/while 循环

格式如下：

```java
do statement while (condition);
```

示例：

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * This is the first sample program in Core Java Chapter3
 * 
 * @version 1.01 1997-03-22
 * @author Gary Cornell
 */
public class Retirement {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// read inputs
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.print("How much money do you need to retire? ");
		double goal = in.nextDouble();
		
		System.out.print("How much money will you contribute every year? ");
		double payment = in.nextDouble();
		
		System.out.print("Interest rate in %: ");
		double interestRate = in.nextDouble();
		
		double balance = 0;
		int years = 0;
		
		String input;
		
		// update account balance while goal isn't reached
		do {
			// add this year's payment and interest
			balance += payment;
			double interest = balance * interestRate / 100;
			balance += interest;
			years++;
			
			// print current balance
			System.out.printf("After year %d, your balance is %,.2f\n", years, balance);
			
			// ask if ready to retire and get input
			System.out.print("Ready to retire? (Y/N) ");
			input = in.next();
		} while (input.equals("N"));
		
		System.out.println("You can retire in " + years + " years.");
	}

}
```

### 3. for 循环

示例：

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

> 警告
>
> 在循环中，检测两个浮点数是否相等需要格外小心，下面的 for 循环可能永远不会结束：
>
> ```java
> for (double x = 0; x != 10; x+= 0.1) {
>     ...
> }
> ```
